Those who maintain this project do so as volunteers and we have no control over their schedule or priorities.

This means if the feature you are proposing is something you'd like to see added the best way to achieve that is for you to organise the effort required to build it. This could be evangelising for the feature, paying someone, doing it yourself, etc.

Even so it might never get merged because the trade off between additional happy users and maintenance burden is not favourable.
