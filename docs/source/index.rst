jupyter-repo2docker
===================

**jupyter-repo2docker** is a tool to build, run, and push Docker
images from source code repositories. repo2docker fetches a repository
(e.g., from GitHub or other locations) and builds a container image
based on the configuration files found in the repository. It can be
used to explore a repository locally by building and executing the
constructed image of the repository.
