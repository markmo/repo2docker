jupyter-repo2docker
===================

**jupyter-repo2docker** is a tool to build, run, and push Docker
images from source code repositories. repo2docker fetches a repo
(e.g., from GitHub or other locations) and builds a container image based
on the specifications found in the repo.
Optionally, it can launch a local
Jupyter Notebook which you can use to explore it.
