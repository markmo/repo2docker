Supported configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a list of supported configuration files.

.. contents::
   :local:

``requirements.txt``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This specifies a list of python packages that would be installed in a virtualenv (or conda environment).

``environment.yml``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a conda environment specification, that lets you install packages with conda.

.. important::

   You must leave the ``environment.yml``'s name field empty for this
   to work out of the box.

``apt.txt``
^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of debian packages that should be installed. The base image used is usually the latest released
version of Ubuntu (currently Zesty.)

``postBuild``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A script that can contain arbitrary commands to be run after the whole repository has been built. If you
want this to be a shell script, make sure the first line is `#!/bin/bash`.

.. note::

   This file must be executable to be used with ``repo2docker``. To do this,
   run the following::

     chmod +x postBuild

``REQUIRE``
^^^^^^^^^^^

This specifies a list of Julia packages!

.. note::

   Using a ``REQUIRE`` file also requires that the repository contain an
   ``environment.yml`` file.

``runtime.txt``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This allows you to control the runtime of Python. To use Python 2,
put the line ``python-2.7`` in the file. A Python 2 kernel will be installed
alongside Python 3.

``Dockerfile``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will be treated as a regular Dockerfile and a regular Docker build will be performed. The presence
of a Dockerfile will cause all other building behavior to not be triggered.

Using ``repo2docker`` with a JupyterHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to use ``repo2docker`` in order to build JupyterHub-ready
Docker images. In order for this to work properly, **the version of the ``jupyterhub``
package in your git repository must match the version in your JupyterHub
deployment**. For example, if your JupyterHub deployment runs ``jupyterhub==0.8``,
you should put the following in ``requirements.txt`` or ``environment.yml``::

  jupyterhub==0.8.*
