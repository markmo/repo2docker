Installing ``repo2docker``
==========================

Installing ``repo2docker`` is easiest using the python
packaging index. In addition, you need to install
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ as it is required in
order to build images.

To install ``repo2docker`` from pypi, the python packaging index::

  pip install jupyter-repo2docker

To install from source and start contributing::

  git clone https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker.git
  cd repo2docker
  pip install -e .

That's it! For information on using ``repo2docker``, see
:ref:`usage`.
