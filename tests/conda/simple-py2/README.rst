Conda Environment and Python 2
------------------------------

``environment.yml`` is the standard method for defining environments with the
Anaconda (conda) distribution. Conda environment files may allow for more
complex builds and dependencies than are possible with a single
``requirements.txt`` file.

This example shows how to define a Python 2 environment with Anaconda. You can
define any version of Python that Anaconda supports.
